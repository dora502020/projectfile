symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. It is a significant public health concern affecting individuals of all ages, with onset commonly occurring in childhood. Understanding asthma is crucial for medical students, as effective management can significantly improve patients' quality of life.</p><hr><p><strong>Epidemiology</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Prevalence</strong>: Asthma affects approximately 300 million people worldwide.</li><li><strong>Age and Gender</strong>: More common in male children but in adulthood, the prevalence is higher in females.</li><li><strong>Geographical Variation</strong>: Higher prevalence in urbanized and developed countries.</li><li><strong>Mortality</strong>: Although asthma is manageable, it can be fatal if not properly treated.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Etiology and Risk Factors</strong></p><p>Asthma results from a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Genetic Factors</strong>:</p><ul><li>Family history of asthma or atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis).</li><li>Polymorphisms in genes related to immune response (e.g., IL-4, IL-13).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Environmental Factors</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Allergens</strong>: House dust mites, pollen, pet dander, mold.</li><li><strong>Irritants</strong>: Tobacco smoke, air pollution, occupational exposures.</li><li><strong>Infections</strong>: Respiratory viral infections, especially in early childhood.</li><li><strong>Diet</strong>: Low intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids.</li><li><strong>Others</strong>: Obesity, exposure to antibiotics early in life.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Pathophysiology</strong></p><p>Asthma is characterized by:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Chronic Airway Inflammation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Infiltration of eosinophils, mast cells, T-helper 2 (Th2) lymphocytes.</li><li>Release of inflammatory mediators (histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines).</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Airway Hyperresponsiveness (AHR)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response to stimuli.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Airflow Obstruction</strong>:</p><ul><li>Reversible narrowing of airways due to smooth muscle contraction, mucus hypersecretion, and airway edema.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Airway Remodeling</strong>:</p><ul><li>Structural changes due to prolonged inflammation (thickening of the basement membrane, smooth muscle hypertrophy).</li></ul></li></ol><hr><p><strong>Clinical Features</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Symptoms</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Wheezing</strong>: High-pitched whistling sounds, especially during expiration.</li><li><strong>Cough</strong>: Often worse at night or early morning.</li><li><strong>Shortness of Breath</strong>: Dyspnea, feeling of tightness in the chest.</li><li><strong>Chest Tightness</strong>: Pressure or constriction sensation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Triggers</strong>:</p><ul><li>Exercise (Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction).</li><li>Cold air.</li><li>Allergens and irritants.</li><li>Emotional stress.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Patterns</strong>:</p><ul><li>Symptoms are variable over time and in intensity.</li><li>Often worse at night or early morning (nocturnal asthma).</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p><p><strong>1.
